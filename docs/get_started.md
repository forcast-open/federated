# Forcast Federated Learning

Start by reading the following tutorials that walk you through the main FFL
concepts and APIs using practical examples. Make sure to follow the
[installation instructions](https://github.com/forcast-open/federated/blob/master/docs/install.md) to configure your environment for use with FFL.

*   [Federated Learning for image classification](https://github.com/forcast-open/federated/blob/master/examples/notebooks/image_classification_mnist.ipynb)
    introduces the key parts of the Federated Learning (FL) API, and
    demonstrates how to use FFL to simulate federated learning on federated
    MNIST data.


## Federated-Api

For a realist simulation and an example of a deployable api of the server side service of a federated training procedure, check out the [federated-api](https://github.com/forcast-open/federated-api) repository.
